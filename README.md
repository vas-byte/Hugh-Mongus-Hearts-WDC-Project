# WDC GROUP 70 FINAL SUBMISSION

This repository contains the final submission for the WDC Group 70 project.

For our project, we have chosen to implement a blood donation platform
that connects a range of volunteering organisations. (Multi-organisation 
approach).

To get started please complete the following:
- Clone repository to empty folder
- Open repository in dev container
- Navigate to express folder 'cd express' (this contains the web app)
- Run 'npm install'
- Run 'service mysql start'
- Run 'mysql < final.sql'
- And to run the application, 'npm start'

Please note: The final.sql database should be used for marking,
it contains an admin account that can be used to assess that
aspect of the required functionality. The blank database
(database.sql) has no users so there is no way of signing up
the first admin (you need at least 1 admin to sign up others)

ADMIN ACCOUNT
Email: admin@admin.com
Password: password

DEMO USER ACCOUNT
Email: user1@user.com
Password: password

More accounts can be added but use the admin account to either
promote them to admin or to organisation manager.
